## My Review

Gotta say, I like lavacord. However there is one think I do not like about it.

To make this actually work with discord.js, you need to run `npm install @lavacord/discord.js` for it to run correctly and not error. I find this a bit dumb, as I need to install a whole othr package to make it work, unlike lets say shoukaku or lavaclient.

I do indeed like the package, but when I first tried to use it about a month back, It errored for me preventing me from using it. 

### I rate this a 9/10, pretty good package.
